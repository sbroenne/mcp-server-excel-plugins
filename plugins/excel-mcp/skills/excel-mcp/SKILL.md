# Excel MCP Server Skill

Provides 326 Excel operations through the official MCP SDK and
an in-process ExcelMCP Service. Tool schemas describe the available actions and
parameters; these notes cover behavior that schemas alone cannot explain.

## Choose the intended workbook

- Requires Windows and desktop Microsoft Excel 2016 or later.
- Use `file(action: 'list')` to discover existing sessions before opening a file.
  Match the user's intended workbook; do not automatically choose any open session.
- Use a supplied full Windows path, not a guessed username or folder. Ask when
  the intended file or a destructive change remains unclear.
- A workbook must not be open in another Excel instance.
- Excel is hidden by default. Use `show: true` or `window(action: 'show')` when
  requested. Do not impose a visibility menu on every task.

## Session and saving behavior

`file(action: 'open'/'create', path: '...')` returns `session_id`. Pass it as
`session_id` on every session-based call. `file(list)` entries instead contain
`sessionId`; copy that value into the canonical `session_id` argument.
CLI and MCP sessions are separate and their IDs cannot be exchanged.

Only supply arguments applicable to the selected action. Unknown names,
inapplicable arguments (including nulls/defaults), and incorrect types are errors.
Send numbers and booleans as JSON values, not strings. Range values are 2D arrays.

Close only when authorized, work is finished, and `file(list)` reports `canClose: true`.
Leave the workbook open when requested:

```
file(action: 'close', session_id: '<returned-id>', save: true)
```

Close defaults to `save: false`, which discards unsaved edits. Normal server
shutdown attempts to save remaining sessions; do not rely on it as a substitute
for an explicit save. Crashes, timeouts, and forced cleanup can lose edits.
Confirm before closing a visible window unless already authorized.
The server does not request confirmation through MCP elicitation; obtain any
needed consent in the client conversation before calling the tool.

Cancellation is not undo. A cancelled operation may have changed a workbook.
The affected session may be closed, and cancelled startup is cleaned up after
Excel finishes opening. Inspect `file(list)` before continuing; do not blindly
retry a change or substitute a different session.

## Work within the request

- Read-only tasks need no writes, formatting, Tables, charts, or PivotTables.
- Prefer targeted updates over deleting and rebuilding workbook structures.
- Create an Excel Table when requested or required, for example before adding
  worksheet data to the Data Model. Do not convert every range automatically.
- `range` owns values, formulas, and number formats. `range_format` owns visual
  styling, validation, and sizing. Table styling belongs to `table`; PivotTable
  cell formatting can be overwritten on refresh.
- Preserve existing formats unless the task calls for changing them. When
  applying number formats, use US format codes; rendered separators follow the
  user's locale. Check widths if new formats display as `#####`.

## Bulk writes

For bulk writes where repeated recalculation is costly, read the current mode, switch to
manual, perform the writes, calculate once, and restore the prior mode even
after an error, as in a `finally` block. Reading values or formulas does not
require changing the mode, and intermediate results may require calculation.

```
calculation_mode(action: 'get-mode', session_id: '<returned-id>')
calculation_mode(action: 'set-mode', session_id: '<returned-id>', mode: 'manual')
```

After writing, use `calculation_mode(action: 'calculate', session_id: '<returned-id>', scope: 'workbook')`
and restore the mode returned by the first call.

## Data Model and Power Query

Worksheet tables and Data Model tables are separate. Add a worksheet table to
the Data Model before creating DAX measures. Refresh the Data Model after
changing the source table.

Prefer `powerquery(action: 'evaluate', session_id: id, m_code: '...')` for new or
materially changed M code. Create loads data to its selected destination
(`worksheet` by default); choose `connection-only` to store without loading.
Use `load-to` to change destinations and `refresh` to update already-loaded data.
Update refreshes by default unless `refresh: false` is supplied.

Use `file(test)` when workbook access or IRM/AIP protection is uncertain. Ordinary
validation opens briefly in Excel read-only; protected files may need visible
authentication. Testing does not bypass authentication.

## Reference documentation

Start with the [complete task-guide index](./references/index.md) to find the
relevant topic. Examples use `sessionId` as a local variable containing the
returned session ID; pass it as `session_id`, not as an invented literal.

Shared guides are skill references, not MCP prompts or automatically loaded
server instructions. This server advertises tools, not prompts or resources.
