# Conditional formatting

Read existing rules before adding or replacing them. Rules are returned in
priority order with their applies-to ranges and type-specific settings.
Clear rules only when replacing the existing formatting is intended.

## Examples

For an existing `Data` sheet and captured session, highlight amounts greater
than 100, or separately highlight rows whose first column says Active:

```text
conditionalformat(action: 'add-rule', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Data', range_address: 'B2:B100', rule_type: 'cell-value', operator_type: 'greater', formula1: '100', interior_color: '#FFFF00')
conditionalformat(action: 'add-rule', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Data', range_address: 'A2:E100', rule_type: 'expression', formula1: '=$A2="Active"', interior_color: '#90EE90')
conditionalformat(action: 'list-worksheet-rules', session_id: sessionId, sheet_name: 'Data')
```


Check each result. Expression formulas use the top-left target cell's perspective.
Use `$A2` for a fixed column and relative row, or `$A$2` for one fixed cell.
PowerShell single quotes preserve dollar signs in formulas.

## Choosing a rule

| Type | Key requirements |
|------|------------------|
| cell-value | Operator plus formula1; between/not-between also need formula2 |
| expression | A formula returning TRUE/FALSE |
| color-scale | Minimum/maximum stops; a middle stop creates a three-color scale |
| data-bar | Color, limits, direction, negative color, and value visibility |
| icon-set | Icon family and threshold settings for editable bands |
| top10 | Rank, top/bottom choice, and whether the rank is a percentage |
| above-average | Above/below average or standard-deviation choice |
| time-period | Relative date period such as today or this week |
| unique-values | Unique/duplicate-value highlighting |
| blanks-condition | Blank-cell highlighting |

Colors use `#RRGGBB`. Visual thresholds may use minimum, maximum, number, percent,
percentile, or formula as supported by that rule. Supply a value when the chosen
threshold type needs one. Use the discovered schema or command reference for
the precise options rather than sending properties from another rule type.

Read-back details include color-scale stops, data-bar limits and direction,
icon criteria, top/bottom rank, average mode, or date period only for the matching
rule type. Numeric formulas may be normalized (100 becomes `=100`); compare their
meaning, not just their original spelling.
