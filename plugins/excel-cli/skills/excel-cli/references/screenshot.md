> **CLI syntax note:** This shared domain guide may use MCP-style `tool(action: ...)` examples as conceptual shorthand. Do not translate or paste those calls mechanically. Use the exact commands and kebab-case options in [cli-commands.md](./cli-commands.md) or live `--help`; notably, MCP `file` open/close maps to CLI `session` open/close, and MCP `worksheet` maps to CLI `sheet`.# Screenshot & Visual Verification Reference

## REQUIRED: Screenshot After Chart Creation

**You MUST call `screenshot` after creating any chart when visual output is requested or implied.** Do not close the file or end your response without capturing a screenshot.

```
1. chart(create-from-range, ...)  → Chart created
2. screenshot(capture, rangeAddress='A1:M20')  ← REQUIRED — never skip this step
3. file(close, save=true)
```

This rule applies even if:
- The chart was created on the first try
- No errors occurred
- The task description doesn't explicitly say "take a screenshot"

## Tools

- **`screenshot`**: Capture worksheet content as PNG images

## Actions

| Action | Purpose | Parameters |
|--------|---------|------------|
| `capture` | Capture a specific range | `rangeAddress` (default: A1:Z30), `sheetName`, `quality` |
| `capture-sheet` | Capture the worksheet's used cell range | `sheetName`, `quality` |

`capture-sheet` is cell-driven: it captures Excel's used range. On a chart-only worksheet, or when a chart extends beyond the used cells, use `capture` with an explicit range that covers the chart (for example, `A1:M25`).

## Quality Parameter

Default is `Medium` — use this for most cases. Only use `High` when fine text or formulas need careful inspection.

| Quality | Format | Scale | Size |
|---------|--------|-------|------|
| `Medium` | JPEG | 75% | ~4-8x smaller than High (default) |
| `Low` | JPEG | 50% | Smallest, good for layout overview |
| `High` | PNG | 100% | Full fidelity, largest file |

## When to Use Screenshots

### After Chart Creation or Positioning
```
1. chart(create-from-range, ..., targetRange='F2:K15')
2. screenshot(capture, rangeAddress='A1:O25')  → Verify chart doesn't overlap data
```

### After Complex Formatting
```
1. range(set-number-format, ...)
2. conditionalformat(add-rule, ...)
3. screenshot(capture-sheet)  → Verify formatting looks correct
```

### After PivotTable Layout Changes
```
1. pivottable(add-row-field, ...)
2. pivottable(add-value-field, ...)
3. screenshot(capture, rangeAddress='A1:M25')  → Include charts and verify layout
```

## Best Practices

1. **Verify chart placement**: After creating or repositioning charts, capture a screenshot to confirm no overlap with data or other charts
2. **Capture relevant area**: Use `capture` with a specific range rather than `capture-sheet` when you only need part of the worksheet
3. **Use after multi-step operations**: Screenshots are most valuable after a sequence of formatting, layout, or chart operations
4. **MCP returns image directly**: The image is returned as native ImageContent — no file handling needed
5. **Chart-only sheets need an explicit range**: `capture-sheet` uses the used cell range and may omit charts when no cells are used
6. **CLI with `--output`**: Use `excelcli screenshot capture --sheet <name> --range A1:M25 --output screenshot.png` to save the image directly
7. **Apply formatting once**: Apply each formatting operation (bold, fill color, number format) to a given range only once. Do not reapply unless a subsequent step explicitly changes or clears it — redundant calls waste turns and cost.

## Common Patterns

### Chart Overlap Verification
```
1. range(get-used-range) → "A1:D20"
2. chart(create-from-range, sourceRange='A1:D20', targetRange='F2:K15')
3. screenshot(capture, rangeAddress='A1:K20')
   → Visually confirm chart is positioned next to data, not on top of it
```

### Multi-Chart Dashboard Layout
```
When creating dashboards with multiple charts:

1. get-used-range → Know where data ends
2. Create Chart 1 with targetRange below/beside data
3. Create Chart 2 with targetRange that does NOT overlap Chart 1
4. Create Chart 3, Chart 4, etc. — each in a non-overlapping targetRange
5. screenshot(capture, rangeAddress='A1:M40') → Verify NO charts overlap each other or data

Key rules for multi-chart layouts:
- Use targetRange for every chart — never rely on default positioning
- Leave at least 1-2 rows/columns between charts
- Place charts in a grid pattern (e.g., 2x2) below the data area
- If overlap detected, use chart(fit-to-range) to reposition
```

### Dashboard Layout Check
```
1. Create multiple charts and tables
2. screenshot(capture, rangeAddress='A1:M40')
   → Verify overall dashboard layout, spacing, and alignment
3. If issues found: reposition with chart(fit-to-range), then screenshot again
```
