# Window management

Window operations affect only the selected session's Excel instance. Use the
captured session ID; do not create another session to change visibility.

## Worksheet views

The named worksheet must exist. Freeze counts describe the rows above and columns
left of the boundary; at least one must be positive. A movable split disables
frozen panes. Set zoom/display options before a split when exact counts matter.


```powershell
excelcli -q window freeze-panes --session $sessionId --sheet Summary --frozen-rows 1 --frozen-columns 1
excelcli -q window set-zoom --session $sessionId --sheet Summary --zoom 125
excelcli -q window get-view --session $sessionId --sheet Summary
```

Zoom ranges from 10 to 400 percent. Display options control gridlines, headings,
outline symbols, and formulas. Omitted flags remain unchanged. Unfreeze removes
frozen panes and splits; setting both split counts to zero removes movable splits.

## Visibility and placement

Show Excel when requested. Arrange presets are left-half, right-half, top-half,
bottom-half, center, and full-screen; they use Excel's current monitor work area.
Arranging makes Excel visible. Normal/maximized states also make it visible.
Positioning uses points and restores a normal window state first.

Use get-info to inspect visibility, bounds, state, and foreground status. Session
listings reflect show/hide changes. For status-bar feedback and closing visible
windows, see [working with visible Excel](excel_agent_mode.md).
